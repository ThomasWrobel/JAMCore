/**
 *
 * Things to make things!
 * 
 * Every core class used to make other classes should go here.
 * Specifically its so a implementation can pass though its own factory methods to make the correct subtype.
 * ie. a gwt implementation will pass gwt factory classes so that the JAMCore can make GWT specific objects without knowing anything 
 * about gwt itself.
 * 
 * See; SoundObjectFactory for a simple example of how this works.
 * 
 * Note; we keep relevant interfaces here as well (like IsJamSoundObject)
